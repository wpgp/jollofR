\title{plotRast: Produces multi-panel maps of the raster files of the grid-cell disaggregated structured population counts}
\usage{
plotRast(title, output_dir, raster_files, names, nrow, ncol)
}
\arguments{
\item{title}{This is the title of the multi-panel maps of the gridded structured estimates}

\item{output_dir}{The directory for saving the raster files of the disaggregated population estimates}

\item{raster_files}{The names of the raster files to visualize. This must be the same as saved in the raster output folder}

\item{names}{A user-defined names for the plot panels labels. For example, this could be the labels of different age groups.
It must be the same length as the 'raster_files'.}

\item{nrow}{Number of rows of the multi-panel maps. The value depends on the number of groups being displayed.}

\item{ncol}{Number of columns of the multi-panel maps. The value depends on the number of groups being displayed.
For example, for 12 raster files the products of ncol and nrow must be at least 12.}
}
\value{
A graphic image of the multi-panel maps of population disaggregated raster files
}
\description{
This function produces multi-panel maps of the raster files across the various demographic groups of interest.
The input data could come from any of the jolloR disaggregation functions at grid cell levels, e.g.,'sprinkle', 'spray', 'splash',
'sprinkle1', 'spray1', 'and splash1',
